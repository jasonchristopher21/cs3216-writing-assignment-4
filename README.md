# CS3216 Writing Assignment 4

Is my assignment generated by ChatGPT API?

## Setup

Code is provided in the `script.py` file. This will read an OpenAI API key from the environment file.

## Details on the Model

Model used is GPT 3.5 Turbo that supports 16k tokens, as lots of input is sent.

Model temperature is currently set to 0.7, so expect that the result might be different on every run. This is also to ensure "creativity" xD.

## Notes on the Prompt

Some concepts from the lecture is being used:

- Sanitising inputs: System prompt is made to avoid the user from entering prompt that can invoke the prompt and model details. Although, by seeing this code, technically you would know the details already :O
- Few-shot prompting: I added a sample prompt and my Weekly Assignment 3 essay (which is mostly written by me) so that the model knows the way I usually write.

Concepts not covered:
- Validating outputs: I think this is not relevant for a very very tiny scale project like this.
- LangChain: same reason as above.

## Original Output

Attending Dr Umair's lecture on language models and their applications has certainly broadened my understanding of AI and its potential uses. The lecture introduced several key points that I found particularly intriguing and insightful.

Firstly, the lecture discussed the concept of prompt engineering and the importance of validating outputs. I have previously worked with ChatGPT and other language models, but I never fully grasped the significance of prompt engineering until now. Dr Umair emphasized the need to sanitize inputs and validate outputs to ensure that the model provides accurate and relevant responses. This is crucial in maintaining the integrity and safety of AI applications. The lecture provided practical tips, such as fine-tuning the model to validate input and handling empty outputs and hallucinations. I found these insights valuable and applicable to my own projects.

Another fascinating aspect of the lecture was the introduction of LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models. I had heard of LangChain before, but I never fully understood its purpose until now. Dr Umair explained that LangChain simplifies the development process by providing components and off-the-shelf chains for accomplishing higher-level tasks. This framework allows language models to interact with the environment and connect with other sources of data. I found this concept to be a powerful tool for building AI applications and enhancing their capabilities.

The lecture also touched upon the importance of structured output and the use of vision transformers in image generation. The introduction of Vision Transformer by Google and its application in generating images through OpenAI's DALL-E was intriguing. This showcased the versatility of language models in various domains beyond just chat-based applications.

From a personal perspective, I have had previous experience using LangChain during an internship. However, I did not fully grasp its potential and purpose at the time. This lecture clarified the concept for me and highlighted its value in simplifying the development process.

Additionally, I have worked on ChatCompletions projects in the past, but I never fully understood the intricacies of prompt engineering until now. Dr Umair's emphasis on prompt phrasing and the importance of sanitizing inputs resonated with my previous struggles in ensuring the safety and relevance of AI-generated responses.

Lastly, I appreciate the lecture's focus on AI as more than just a chatbot. The applications and possibilities of AI extend far beyond simple conversational interactions. Dr Umair's demonstration of LangChain and its capabilities exemplified how AI can be utilized to solve complex problems and enhance user experiences.

In conclusion, Dr Umair's lecture provided valuable insights into prompt engineering, LangChain, and the broader applications of AI. I now have a deeper understanding of these concepts and their practical implications. I am excited to apply this newfound knowledge to my future projects and explore the potential of AI-driven solutions in solving real-world problems.

## Modifications to original output

Following modifications are done:

- Change "Dr. Umair" to "Dr. Shubham" on the LangChain paragraphs
- Change to british english (apparently GPT is bad at this)
- Add some personal perspectives, I guess?
- Minor modifications to the lecture topic
